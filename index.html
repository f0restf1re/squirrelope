        <h2>"Heat Dumping"</h2>
        <p>When the antelope squirrel's body temperature reaches its upper limits, it will get into a cool, shady spot and lay down spread-eagle with their belly pressed against the cool ground. This releases the heat from its body to help cool the animal down. (<a href="https://www.desertmuseum.org/kids/oz/long-fact-sheets/Harris's%20Antelope%20ground%20Squirrel.php">Source</a>)</p>

        <h2>The Parasol Tail</h2>
        <p>When the surrounding temperature exceeds about 40â„ƒ, the antelope squirrel may erect its tails and turn its backs to the sun, reducing heat input considerably. (Solar radiation from the sun is obstructed by the tail, which provides shade. Radiation absorbed by the tail is not absorbed by rest of the body so less surface-area to mass of squirrel is exposed to radiation). <br> &nbsp; This behavioral use of the tail as a heat shield more than doubles the time available to squirrels for continuous surface foraging, adding 4h to the 3h sustainable with tail-down behavior alone.

            <h3>How much do you like antelope squirrels?</h3>
            <p>Maybe if I actually finish my homework first, I'll come back to make some antelope squirrel quiz. In the meantime, try these embedded things I found online (that are not actually about the antelope squirrel but is about squirrels and thermoregulation)!</p>
